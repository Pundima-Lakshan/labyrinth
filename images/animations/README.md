# Animations

The animations in this directory and the `generation_algorithms` subdirectory
were created using the community version of [Manim](https://github.com/ManimCommunity/manim),
an animation library originally created by Grant Sanderson of the YouTube channel
[3Blue1Brown](https://www.youtube.com/c/3blue1brown). The code used to produce the animations
is located in the [scripts](../../scripts/animation.py) directory. For more information on Manim,
check out the official Manim [documentation](https://docs.manim.community/en/v0.5.0/index.html).
